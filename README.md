The comprehensive experimental benchmark of cancer driver and neutral mutations. Mutation annotations were obtained from the previous seven experimental studies:

Martelotto, L.G. et al. Benchmarking mutation effect prediction algorithms using functionally validated cancer-related missense mutations. Genome Biol 15, 484 (2014).
Olivier, M. et al. The IARC TP53 database: new online mutation analysis and recommendations to users. Hum Mutat 19, 607-14 (2002)
Starita, L.M. et al. Massively Parallel Functional Analysis of BRCA1 RING Domain Variants. Genetics 200, 413-22 (2015)
Mahmood, K. et al. Variant effect prediction tools assessed using independent, functional assay-based datasets: implications for discovery and diagnostics. Hum Genomics 11, 10 (2017)
Campbell, B.B. et al. Comprehensive Analysis of Hypermutation in Human Cancer. Cell 171, 1042-1056 e10 (2017)
Ng, P.K. et al. Systematic Functional Annotation of Somatic Mutations in Cancer. Cancer Cell 33(3), 450-462(2018)
Hartmaier, R. J. et al. High-throughput genomic profiling of adult solid tumors reveals novel insights into cancer pathogenesis. Cancer Research 77, 2464-2475 (2017)

'Driver' and 'passenger' labels were assigned according to Brown AL, Li M, Goncearenco A, Panchenko AR Finding driver mutations in cancer: Elucidating the role of background mutational processes.
